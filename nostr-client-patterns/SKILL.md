# Nostr Client Patterns

## Overview

Implement robust Nostr client architecture. This skill covers the patterns
agents miss: relay pool connection management, subscription state machines that
correctly handle EOSE/CLOSED transitions, event deduplication across relays,
optimistic UI with OK message error recovery, and reconnection with gap-free
event delivery.

## When to Use

- The task is building or debugging a Nostr client’s relay, subscription, caching, publish, or reconnect architecture.
- The user needs client-side patterns for handling relay pools, EOSE/CLOSED states, deduplication, or optimistic UI.
- The problem is lifecycle management of events in a client, not protocol selection or relay-server code.
- The request involves missed events, duplicate events, relay churn, or local cache behavior.

**Do NOT use when:**

- The task is constructing event JSON or tags.
- The work is relay-server implementation.
- The main problem is filter design rather than client architecture.


## Response format

Always structure the final response with these top-level sections, in this order:

1. **Summary** — state the task, scope, and main conclusion in 1-3 sentences.
2. **Decision / Approach** — state the key classification, assumptions, or chosen path.
3. **Artifacts** — provide the primary deliverable(s) for this skill. Use clear subheadings for multiple files, commands, JSON payloads, queries, or documents.
4. **Validation** — state checks performed, important risks, caveats, or unresolved questions.
5. **Next steps** — list concrete follow-up actions, or write `None` if nothing remains.

Rules:
- Do not omit a section; write `None` when a section does not apply.
- If files are produced, list each file path under **Artifacts** before its contents.
- If commands, JSON, SQL, YAML, or code are produced, put each artifact in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag when possible.
- Keep section names exactly as written above so output stays predictable across skills.

## Workflow

### 1. Design the Relay Pool

A relay pool manages WebSocket connections to multiple relays. Each relay
connection has a lifecycle that must be tracked independently.

**Connection states:**

```
disconnected → connecting → connected → disconnecting → disconnected
                    ↓                        ↑
                  failed ──(backoff)──→ connecting
```

**Key rules:**

- **One WebSocket per relay** (NIP-01). Never open parallel connections to the
  same relay URL.
- Normalize relay URLs before comparing: lowercase scheme/host, remove trailing
  slash, default port 443 for wss.
- Track state per relay:
  `{ url, ws, state, retryCount, lastConnected,
  activeSubscriptions, pendingPublishes }`.
- Implement connection limits (e.g., max 10 concurrent connections).
- Use NIP-65 relay lists (kind:10002) to determine which relays to connect to
  for each user. Write relays for fetching a user's events, read relays for
  fetching events that mention them.

```typescript
interface RelayConnection {
  url: string;
  ws: WebSocket | null;
  state: "disconnected" | "connecting" | "connected" | "disconnecting";
  retryCount: number;
  lastConnectedAt: number | null;
  lastEoseTimestamps: Map<string, number>; // subId → timestamp
  authChallenge: string | null;
}
```

See [references/relay-pool.md](references/relay-pool.md) for full implementation
patterns including backoff and NIP-42 auth.

### 2. Implement the Subscription Lifecycle

Subscriptions follow a state machine with distinct phases. Getting this wrong
causes either missing events or infinite loading states.

**Subscription states:**

```
idle → loading → live → closed
                  ↑       ↓
                  └─ replacing (new REQ with same sub-id)
```

**The lifecycle:**

1. **Open:** Send `["REQ", "<sub-id>", <filters...>]` to relay(s)
2. **Loading (stored events):** Receive `["EVENT", "<sub-id>", <event>]` for
   historical matches. UI shows loading indicator.
3. **EOSE received:** `["EOSE", "<sub-id>"]` — transition from "loading" to
   "live". Remove loading indicator, display stored events.
4. **Live events:** Continue receiving EVENTs. These are new, real-time events.
   Display immediately.
5. **Close:** Send `["CLOSE", "<sub-id>"]` when the view unmounts or the
   subscription is no longer needed.

**Critical transitions:**

- **EOSE is per-relay.** If subscribed to 5 relays, you get 5 EOSE messages.
  Track EOSE per relay per subscription. Transition to "live" when ALL relays
  have sent EOSE (or timed out).
- **Replacing:** Send a new REQ with the same sub-id to change filters without
  closing. The relay replaces the old subscription. Reset EOSE tracking.
- **CLOSED from relay:** `["CLOSED", "<sub-id>", "<reason>"]` means the relay
  terminated your subscription. Handle by reason prefix:
  - `auth-required:` → authenticate with NIP-42, then re-subscribe
  - `error:` → log error, maybe retry after backoff
  - `restricted:` → user lacks permission, don't retry
- **Timeout:** If a relay doesn't send EOSE within a reasonable time (e.g.,
  10s), treat it as EOSE for that relay to avoid infinite loading.

See [references/subscription-patterns.md](references/subscription-patterns.md)
for state machine implementation and multi-relay coordination.

### 3. Deduplicate Events

The same event can arrive from multiple relays. Events have globally unique IDs
(SHA-256 of serialized content), so deduplication is straightforward.

**Regular events (kinds 1-9999 excluding replaceable):**

```typescript
const seen = new Set<string>();

function processEvent(event: NostrEvent): boolean {
  if (seen.has(event.id)) return false; // duplicate
  seen.add(event.id);
  // process event...
  return true;
}
```

**Replaceable events (kinds 0, 3, 10000-19999):**

Keep only the latest per `pubkey + kind`. When a newer event arrives, replace
the old one. Break ties by lowest `id` (lexicographic comparison).

```typescript
const replaceableKey = `${event.pubkey}:${event.kind}`;
const existing = replaceableStore.get(replaceableKey);
if (existing) {
  if (event.created_at < existing.created_at) return false;
  if (event.created_at === existing.created_at && event.id >= existing.id) {
    return false;
  }
}
replaceableStore.set(replaceableKey, event);
```

**Addressable events (kinds 30000-39999):**

Same as replaceable, but key includes the `d` tag value:

```typescript
const dTag = event.tags.find((t) => t[0] === "d")?.[1] ?? "";
const addressableKey = `${event.pubkey}:${event.kind}:${dTag}`;
```

**Memory management:** Use an LRU cache or periodic cleanup for the `seen` set.
In long-running clients, unbounded sets will leak memory.

### 4. Implement Optimistic UI for Publishing

Show events immediately in the UI before relay confirmation. Handle failures
gracefully.

**The flow:**

```
User action → Create event → Show in UI (optimistic) → Sign → Publish
                                                                  ↓
                                                          Wait for OK
                                                         ↙          ↘
                                                   OK:true        OK:false
                                                   Confirm        Show error
                                                                  Allow retry
```

**Implementation:**

1. Create the unsigned event from user input
2. Add to local state with status `"pending"`
3. Sign the event (NIP-07 browser extension or local key)
4. Send `["EVENT", <signed-event>]` to connected relays
5. Track OK responses per relay:
   - `["OK", "<id>", true, ""]` → mark relay as confirmed
   - `["OK", "<id>", true, "duplicate:"]` → also success (relay already had it)
   - `["OK", "<id>", false, "reason"]` → track failure reason
6. Update UI status:
   - At least one `true` → status `"confirmed"`
   - All relays responded `false` → status `"failed"`, show error, allow retry
   - Timeout (e.g., 10s) with no OK → status `"timeout"`, allow retry

**OK message reason prefixes:**

| Prefix           | Meaning                | Action                   |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `duplicate:`     | Already have it        | Treat as success         |
| `pow:`           | Proof of work issue    | Add PoW and retry        |
| `blocked:`       | Client/user blocked    | Show error, don't retry  |
| `rate-limited:`  | Too many events        | Backoff and retry        |
| `invalid:`       | Protocol violation     | Fix event and retry      |
| `restricted:`    | Permission denied      | Show error, don't retry  |
| `auth-required:` | Need NIP-42 auth first | Authenticate, then retry |
| `error:`         | General relay error    | Retry after backoff      |

### 5. Handle Reconnection

When a relay disconnects, reconnect without losing events or duplicating
subscriptions.

**Reconnection strategy:**

1. Detect disconnect (WebSocket `close` or `error` event)
2. Set relay state to `disconnected`
3. Calculate backoff: `min(baseDelay * 2^retryCount + jitter, maxDelay)`
   - Recommended: base=1s, max=60s, jitter=0-1s random
4. After backoff, set state to `connecting`, open new WebSocket
5. On successful connect:
   - Reset `retryCount` to 0
   - Re-authenticate if relay previously required NIP-42 auth
   - Re-send all active subscriptions with `since` parameter set to the last
     EOSE timestamp for that relay + subscription
6. On failed connect: increment `retryCount`, go to step 3

**Gap-free event delivery:**

The key insight: track the `created_at` of the last event received before
disconnect (or the EOSE timestamp). On reconnect, add `since: lastTimestamp` to
the filter to fetch only events you missed. This avoids re-fetching the entire
history.

```typescript
function reconnectSubscription(
  relay: RelayConnection,
  subId: string,
  originalFilter: Filter,
) {
  const lastSeen = relay.lastEoseTimestamps.get(subId);
  const reconnectFilter = lastSeen
    ? { ...originalFilter, since: lastSeen }
    : originalFilter;
  relay.ws.send(JSON.stringify(["REQ", subId, reconnectFilter]));
}
```

### 6. Cache Events Locally

Reduce bandwidth and improve load times by caching events.

**Cache strategies:**

- **IndexedDB** (browser): Store events by id, index by kind, pubkey,
  created_at. Good for offline-first clients.
- **SQLite** (desktop/mobile): Same schema, better query performance.
- **In-memory LRU** (ephemeral): For deduplication and short-term caching.

**Cache-first loading pattern:**

1. Load cached events matching the filter → display immediately
2. Open subscription with `since: latestCachedTimestamp`
3. Merge new events into cache and UI
4. On EOSE, cache is now up-to-date

**For replaceable events:** Only cache the latest version. When a newer version
arrives, replace the cached entry.

## Checklist

- [ ] Relay pool tracks per-relay connection state with proper lifecycle
- [ ] One WebSocket per relay URL (normalized)
- [ ] Exponential backoff with jitter on reconnection
- [ ] Subscriptions track EOSE per relay, transition loading → live correctly
- [ ] CLOSED messages handled by reason prefix (auth, error, restricted)
- [ ] Events deduplicated by id before processing
- [ ] Replaceable events keep only latest (by created_at, then lowest id)
- [ ] Optimistic UI shows events before relay confirmation
- [ ] OK messages parsed with reason prefix for error handling
- [ ] Reconnection re-subscribes with `since` to avoid gaps
- [ ] Event cache used for faster initial loads

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                   | Why It Breaks                                              | Fix                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Opening multiple WebSockets to same relay | Violates NIP-01, wastes resources, causes duplicate events | Normalize URL and enforce one connection per relay          |
| Treating EOSE as global (not per-relay)   | Loading state never resolves if one relay is slow          | Track EOSE per relay per subscription, use timeout fallback |
| No deduplication of events                | Same event processed multiple times, corrupts counts/UI    | Deduplicate by `event.id` using a Set before processing     |
| Replacing events by `created_at` only     | Tie-breaking is undefined without `id` comparison          | On equal `created_at`, keep the event with the lowest `id`  |
| Showing "failed" on `duplicate:` OK       | Duplicate means the relay already has it — that's success  | Check the reason prefix, not just the boolean               |
| Fixed retry delay (no backoff)            | Hammers relay during outages, may get IP-banned            | Use exponential backoff: `min(base * 2^n + jitter, max)`    |
| Not re-authenticating after reconnect     | NIP-42 auth is per-connection, lost on disconnect          | Store challenge, re-send AUTH event after reconnect         |
| Reconnecting without `since` filter       | Re-fetches entire history, wastes bandwidth                | Track last EOSE timestamp, use `since` on reconnect         |
| Unbounded dedup Set                       | Memory leak in long-running clients                        | Use LRU cache or periodic cleanup                           |
| Ignoring CLOSED messages                  | Subscription silently stops receiving events               | Handle CLOSED, re-subscribe if appropriate                  |

| `AUTH`         | Relay→Client | `["AUTH", challenge]`        | Auth challenge (NIP-42) |

## Key Principles

1. **One connection per relay** — Normalize URLs and enforce a single WebSocket
   per relay. Multiple connections cause duplicate events, wasted bandwidth, and
   violate NIP-01.

2. **EOSE is the loading/live boundary** — Before EOSE, you're receiving stored
   history. After EOSE, you're receiving live events. This distinction drives UI
   state (loading spinners, "new event" indicators).

3. **Deduplicate before processing** — Events have globally unique IDs. Check
   the dedup set before any processing, state updates, or UI rendering. For
   replaceable events, also compare `created_at` and `id` for tie-breaking.

4. **Optimistic with recovery** — Show events immediately, confirm via OK. Parse
   OK reason prefixes to distinguish retriable errors (rate-limited, auth) from
   permanent failures (blocked, restricted).

5. **Reconnect without gaps** — Track the last-seen timestamp per relay per
   subscription. On reconnect, use `since` to fetch only missed events. Always
   re-authenticate and re-subscribe after reconnection.
