# Monitoring Setup

## Overview

Add production-grade observability to any service by instrumenting health
checks, metrics, tracing, and alerts as a cohesive system. The skill treats
monitoring as structured output — not ad-hoc logging — producing files that
integrate with standard observability stacks (Prometheus, Grafana,
OpenTelemetry, PagerDuty/OpsGenie).

## When to use

- The task is to instrument or operationalize an existing service with health checks, metrics, tracing, alerts, or runbooks.
- The user is preparing a system for production readiness, SLOs, or on-call support.
- The deliverable is observability configuration, code instrumentation, and operational guidance.
- The problem is missing monitoring coverage, not analysis of an already-failing monitoring stack.

**Do NOT use when:**

- The task is debugging a current incident or broken observability pipeline.
- The request is only vendor-specific dashboard clicking with no reusable monitoring design.
- The work is log aggregation alone without broader observability requirements.


## Response format

Always structure the final response with these top-level sections, in this order:

1. **Summary** — state the task, scope, and main conclusion in 1-3 sentences.
2. **Decision / Approach** — state the key classification, assumptions, or chosen path.
3. **Artifacts** — provide the primary deliverable(s) for this skill. Use clear subheadings for multiple files, commands, JSON payloads, queries, or documents.
4. **Validation** — state checks performed, important risks, caveats, or unresolved questions.
5. **Next steps** — list concrete follow-up actions, or write `None` if nothing remains.

Rules:
- Do not omit a section; write `None` when a section does not apply.
- If files are produced, list each file path under **Artifacts** before its contents.
- If commands, JSON, SQL, YAML, or code are produced, put each artifact in fenced code blocks with the correct language tag when possible.
- Keep section names exactly as written above so output stays predictable across skills.

## Workflow

### 1. Add health check endpoints

Create three distinct health check endpoints. Each serves a different purpose in
orchestration systems like Kubernetes:

| Endpoint      | Path            | Purpose                            | What to check                                            |
| ------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Liveness**  | `GET /healthz`  | "Is the process alive?"            | Process is running, not deadlocked. Minimal checks only. |
| **Readiness** | `GET /readyz`   | "Can this instance serve traffic?" | Database connected, cache warm, dependencies reachable.  |
| **Startup**   | `GET /startupz` | "Has initialization completed?"    | Migrations run, config loaded, initial data seeded.      |

**Critical distinction:** Liveness should NEVER check external dependencies. If
your liveness probe checks the database and the DB goes down, Kubernetes will
restart your healthy pods — making an outage worse. Liveness = "is this process
fundamentally broken?" Readiness = "should traffic be routed here?"

**Response format:**

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "checks": {
    "database": { "status": "ok", "latency_ms": 2 },
    "cache": { "status": "ok", "latency_ms": 1 },
    "external_api": { "status": "degraded", "latency_ms": 450 }
  },
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "uptime_seconds": 84321
}
```

Return HTTP 200 for healthy, 503 for unhealthy. Include individual check
statuses so operators can see which dependency is failing.

### 2. Instrument metrics collection

Use the RED and USE methods to ensure comprehensive coverage:

**RED method** (for request-driven services):

| Metric       | What to measure              | Prometheus type | Example                                       |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Rate**     | Requests per second          | Counter         | `http_requests_total{method, path, status}`   |
| **Errors**   | Failed requests per second   | Counter         | `http_errors_total{method, path, code}`       |
| **Duration** | Request latency distribution | Histogram       | `http_request_duration_seconds{method, path}` |

**USE method** (for resource-driven components):

| Metric          | What to measure               | Prometheus type | Example                      |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Utilization** | % of resource capacity in use | Gauge           | `db_pool_utilization_ratio`  |
| **Saturation**  | Queue depth / backpressure    | Gauge           | `request_queue_length`       |
| **Errors**      | Resource-level error count    | Counter         | `db_connection_errors_total` |

**Implementation requirements:**

- Use Prometheus client library for the service's language
- Expose metrics at `GET /metrics` in Prometheus exposition format
- Use histogram buckets appropriate for the service:
  `[0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10]` seconds for HTTP
- Label metrics with `method`, `path` (normalized), and `status_code`
- Add a metrics middleware that instruments ALL requests automatically
- Include process metrics (memory, CPU, GC, event loop lag where applicable)

### 3. Add distributed tracing

Implement OpenTelemetry-compatible tracing with correlation ID propagation:

**Trace context propagation:**

- Generate a unique `trace-id` (128-bit hex) for each incoming request without
  one
- Propagate via W3C Trace Context headers: `traceparent`, `tracestate`
- Also support `X-Correlation-ID` / `X-Request-ID` for backward compatibility
- Pass trace context to ALL downstream HTTP calls, message queue publishes, and
  async jobs

**Span creation:**

- Create a root span for each incoming request
- Create child spans for: database queries, external HTTP calls, cache
  operations, message queue operations
- Include span attributes: `http.method`, `http.url`, `http.status_code`,
  `db.system`, `db.statement`
- Set span status to ERROR on failures with error message

**Configuration output** — generate a trace config file:

```javascript
// tracing.js - OpenTelemetry configuration
const { NodeSDK } = require("@opentelemetry/sdk-node");
const { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } = require(
  "@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node",
);
const { OTLPTraceExporter } = require(
  "@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http",
);

const sdk = new NodeSDK({
  traceExporter: new OTLPTraceExporter({
    url: process.env.OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT ||
      "http://localhost:4318/v1/traces",
  }),
  instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()],
  serviceName: process.env.OTEL_SERVICE_NAME || "my-service",
});

sdk.start();
```

### 4. Configure alert thresholds

Define alerts based on SLOs (Service Level Objectives), not arbitrary values.
The process:

1. **Define SLOs** — e.g., "99.9% of requests complete in < 500ms"
2. **Derive SLIs** — the metric that measures the SLO (e.g.,
   `http_request_duration_seconds`)
3. **Set burn rate alerts** — alert when you're consuming error budget too fast

**Alert threshold guidelines:**

| SLO Target | Burn Rate 1h | Burn Rate 6h | Burn Rate 24h |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------- |
| 99.9%      | 14.4x        | 6x           | 3x            |
| 99.5%      | 14.4x        | 6x           | 3x            |
| 99.0%      | 14.4x        | 6x           | 3x            |

**Alert rule format** (Prometheus alerting rules):

```yaml
groups:
  - name: slo-alerts
    rules:
      - alert: HighErrorRate
        expr: |
          (
            sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]))
            /
            sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))
          ) > (1 - 0.999) * 14.4
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: critical
          team: platform
        annotations:
          summary: "Error rate burning through SLO budget at 14.4x"
          description: "Current error rate: {{ $value | humanizePercentage }}"
          runbook: "https://runbooks.example.com/high-error-rate"
          dashboard: "https://grafana.example.com/d/slo-overview"

      - alert: HighLatency
        expr: |
          histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le))
          > 0.5
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
          team: platform
        annotations:
          summary: "P99 latency exceeds 500ms SLO target"
          runbook: "https://runbooks.example.com/high-latency"
```

**Escalation policy:**

| Severity | Response Time | Notification Channel | Escalation After |
| -------- | ------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
| critical | 5 minutes     | PagerDuty page       | 15 min to lead   |
| warning  | 30 minutes    | Slack #alerts        | 2 hours to team  |
| info     | Next business | Slack #monitoring    | None             |

Every alert MUST include a `runbook` annotation linking to resolution steps.

### 5. Create runbook templates

Generate a runbook for each alert with this structure:

```markdown
# Runbook: [Alert Name]

## Alert Details

- **Severity:** critical/warning/info
- **SLO:** Which SLO this protects
- **Dashboard:** Link to relevant Grafana dashboard

## Symptoms

What the operator will observe when this fires.

## Diagnosis Steps

1. Check [specific metric/dashboard]
2. Look for [specific log pattern]
3. Verify [specific dependency]

## Resolution

### If caused by [root cause A]

1. Step-by-step fix

### If caused by [root cause B]

1. Step-by-step fix

## Escalation

- If not resolved in [time]: escalate to [team/person]
- If customer-facing: notify [channel]
```

### 6. Generate dashboard configuration

Produce a Grafana dashboard JSON or config covering:

- **Overview row:** Request rate, error rate, latency P50/P95/P99
- **Health row:** Health check status, uptime, version
- **Resources row:** CPU, memory, DB pool utilization, queue depth
- **SLO row:** Error budget remaining, burn rate, SLO compliance

**Input:** "Add monitoring to our Express.js order service"

**Output files produced:**

| File              | Contents                                            |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `health.js`       | Liveness, readiness, startup route handlers         |
| `metrics.js`      | Prometheus client setup + metrics middleware        |
| `tracing.js`      | OpenTelemetry SDK configuration                     |
| `alert-rules.yml` | Prometheus alerting rules with SLO-based thresholds |
| `runbooks/`       | One markdown file per alert                         |
| `dashboard.json`  | Grafana dashboard configuration                     |

**Example health endpoint implementation:**

```javascript
// health.js
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();
const { Pool } = require("pg");

const startTime = Date.now();
let startupComplete = false;

// Liveness - process alive, no dependency checks
router.get("/healthz", (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({
    status: "ok",
    uptime_seconds: Math.floor((Date.now() - startTime) / 1000),
  });
});

// Readiness - can serve traffic
router.get("/readyz", async (req, res) => {
  const checks = {};
  let healthy = true;

  // Check database
  try {
    const start = Date.now();
    await pool.query("SELECT 1");
    checks.database = { status: "ok", latency_ms: Date.now() - start };
  } catch (err) {
    checks.database = { status: "error", error: err.message };
    healthy = false;
  }

  // Check Redis
  try {
    const start = Date.now();
    await redis.ping();
    checks.cache = { status: "ok", latency_ms: Date.now() - start };
  } catch (err) {
    checks.cache = { status: "error", error: err.message };
    healthy = false;
  }

  res.status(healthy ? 200 : 503).json({
    status: healthy ? "ok" : "unhealthy",
    checks,
    version: process.env.APP_VERSION || "unknown",
    uptime_seconds: Math.floor((Date.now() - startTime) / 1000),
  });
});

// Startup - initialization complete
router.get("/startupz", (req, res) => {
  res.status(startupComplete ? 200 : 503).json({
    status: startupComplete ? "ok" : "starting",
    uptime_seconds: Math.floor((Date.now() - startTime) / 1000),
  });
});

function markStartupComplete() {
  startupComplete = true;
}

module.exports = { router, markStartupComplete };
```

## Common mistakes

| Mistake                                   | Fix                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Liveness checks database/external deps    | Liveness = process health only. Move dependency checks to readiness. DB down + liveness fail = cascading restarts.               |
| Using `console.log` instead of metrics    | Logs are for debugging, metrics are for monitoring. Use counters/histograms for anything you'd alert on.                         |
| Arbitrary alert thresholds ("error > 10") | Derive thresholds from SLOs and burn rates. "10 errors" means nothing without knowing request volume.                            |
| No correlation ID propagation             | Generate trace ID on ingress, propagate to ALL downstream calls. Without this, distributed debugging is impossible.              |
| Missing runbook links on alerts           | Every alert must link to a runbook. An alert without a runbook is just noise that trains operators to ignore alerts.             |
| Single health endpoint for everything     | Separate liveness/readiness/startup. Kubernetes uses them differently; conflating them causes incorrect pod lifecycle decisions. |
| Metrics without labels                    | Always label with method, path, status. Aggregate metrics hide the signal — you need to slice by dimension.                      |
| No histogram buckets for latency          | Use histograms, not averages. P99 latency matters more than mean. Configure buckets for your expected range.                     |

## Key principles

1. **Liveness is sacred** — Never put dependency checks in liveness probes. A
   liveness failure triggers a pod restart. If your DB is down and liveness
   checks the DB, Kubernetes restarts all pods, making recovery harder. Liveness
   answers only: "is this process fundamentally broken?"

2. **SLOs drive alerts** — Every alert threshold must trace back to a Service
   Level Objective. "Error rate > 1%" is meaningless without knowing the SLO.
   Use burn rate alerting: alert when you're consuming error budget faster than
   sustainable.

3. **Metrics over logs** — Anything you would alert on must be a metric, not a
   log line. Metrics are aggregatable, queryable, and cheap. Log-based alerting
   is fragile, expensive, and misses patterns that counters catch naturally.

4. **Trace everything cross-service** — Every request entering the system gets a
   trace ID. Every downstream call propagates it. Without end-to-end tracing,
   debugging distributed systems requires correlating timestamps across log
   streams — which doesn't scale.

5. **Alerts without runbooks are noise** — Every alert must link to a runbook
   with diagnosis steps and resolution procedures. Operators receiving alerts
   without context will either ignore them or waste time investigating from
   scratch. Runbooks encode institutional knowledge.
